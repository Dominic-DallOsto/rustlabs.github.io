# Control Visibility Within Different Files Using 'pub'

When modules get large and become cumbersome to store in a single file, it is possible to move their definitions to a 
separate file to make the code easier to navigate. It is possible to access a module even if it belongs to a different file. 
To use the module in a different file, write mod followed by the name of the file in which the module is declared.

- Implicit Declaration 
A block of code put in a file without wrapping in a mod block implicitly declares a module.

-  Import the module
```
mod file_name
```
- Call the module
```
file_name::x
```
Where `x` can be any construct within the module, i.e., function, array, trait, struct.

 üìù Rust code is always put in files with `.rs` extension
 
# Explicit Declaration 

The code in a file is wrapped within the mod block. This explicitly declares a module.

-  Import the module
 ```
 mod file_name
```
-  Call the module
```
    file_name::module_name::x
```
where x can be any construct within the module, i.e., function, array, trait, struct.

# Privacy Rule 
 - If the module belonging to some other file is to be made accessible then it should be made public by using the pub keyword before the mod.
 
üìùOnce the module is made public using pub, all privacy rules for defining modules within the same file apply.

# Example 

The following example shows how a module in another file can be accessed.
- Implicit declaration
The following example declares a module implicitly in a file `my_mod.rs` and calls it from `main.rs`.
Note: In implicit declaration modules are public by default

main.rs
```
mod my_mod; 

fn main() {

  println!("Invoke function in my_mod.rs");  

  my_mod::my_public_function();

}

```
my_mod.rs
```
// declare a module
pub fn my_public_function() {
    println!("I am a public function in my_mod.rs");
}

```
output 

```
Invoke function in my_mod.rs
I am a public function in my_mod.rs

```

# Explicit declaration
- The following example declares a module module in a file `my_mod.rs` and call it from `main.rs`.

main.rs
```
mod my_mod; 

fn main() {

  println!("I am a public function in my_mod.rs");

  my_mod::module::my_public_function();

}

```
my_mod.rs
```
// declare a module
pub mod module{
pub fn my_public_function() {
    println!("I am a public function in my_mod.rs");
}
}

```
output 

```
I am a public function in my_mod.rs
I am a public function in my_mod.rs

```

# Implicit declaration of a module in a different file makes them public by default.
- [ ] True
