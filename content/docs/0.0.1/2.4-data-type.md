#### What Are Data Types?

- Data Type

Rust is a statically typed language, meaning, it must know the type of all variables at compile time.

#### How to Define a Type in Rust?

We can define a variable in rust in two different ways:

- Implicit Definition 

Unlike other languages like C++ and Java, Rust can infer the type from the type of value assigned to a variable.


The general syntax is:

```

let variable name = value ;

```

#### Explicit Definition 

Explicitly tells the compiler about the type of variable.

Syntax 

The general syntax is:

```
let variable name : data type  = value ;

```

### Primitive Types

Rust has a couple of types that are considered primitive. That means they are built-in to the language. There are different data types used for different purposes.

The following illustration shows the different primitive data types in Rust:

### Scalar Type

They store a single value.
- Below is the list of scalar types:
   - Integers
   - Floats
   - Boolean
   - Character

#### Compound Type

They group multiple values in one variable. Below is the list of compound types:
- Array
- Tuple
